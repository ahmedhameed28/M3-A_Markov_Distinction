## Program Description
A program that reads in input text, populates a frequency table of previous character occurrences in input text (only looking at the previous character for each character), creates new text based off of the previous occurrence counts, and then finally, generate unique visual output for each character in the newly produced text using a mapping of common characters to visual elements.
